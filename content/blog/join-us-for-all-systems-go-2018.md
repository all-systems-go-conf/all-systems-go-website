The All Systems Go! organizing team is happy to announce this year’s conference is taking place September 28th-30th at [Spreewerkstaetten](http://spreewerkstaetten.de/)—the same venue as last year—in Berlin. This year we’ll have two presentation days–Friday and Saturday–with a hackfest on Sunday.

## Thanks to sponsors

Before jumping into details we’d like to thank our sponsors. All Systems Go! Is only possible with the support of our top sponsors [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/), [Kinvolk](https://kinvolk.io/) and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) and other sponsors, [Axis](https://www.axis.com/de-de), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) and [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/).

## Hackfest

Based on feedback we’ve received last year, we've added a Hackfest on the final day this year. Attendees asked to have more time to sit down, discuss and work on problems together. The Hackfest will take place at the conference venue.

## Project hackfests

In addition to the conference hackfest, we are looking to help projects organize hackfests around All Systems Go!. We will be attempting to match local Berlin companies that can provide space with projects that need space. If you are a company that can provide space or a project that needs space please register your interest with [this sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vTrcxhmdFoGaNTVvDMLyI0k-kvaTBsRs5w1WkQevsJ8/). We'll be processing these on a first come, best fit basis.

## Tickets

We are committed to making the conference accessible to all. Tickets prices range from 35 EUR for early-bird student tickets to 450 EUR for late corporate tickets. Tickets will be made available April 2nd.

And with that, we hope to see you at All Systems Go! 2018. [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASGConf) for updates. If you have any questions or comments [let the organizing team know](mailto:org-team@all-systems-go.io).
