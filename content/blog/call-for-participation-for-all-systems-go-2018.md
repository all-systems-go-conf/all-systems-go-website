It’s with pleasure–and some delay–that we announce the Call for Participation (CFP) is open for [All Systems Go! 2018](https://all-systems-go.io) (Sept. 28th-30th). As such, we’d like to invite you to submit your proposals for consideration to the [CFP submission site](https://cfp.all-systems-go.io/en/ASG2018/cfp).

The CFP will close on July 30th. Notification of acceptance and non-acceptance will go out within 7 days of the closing of the CFP.

## Presentation Topics

All topics relevant to foundational open-source Linux technologies are welcome. In particular, however, we are looking for proposals including, but not limited to, the following topics:

* Low-level container executors and infrastructure
* IoT and embedded OS infrastructure
* BPF
* OS, container, IoT image delivery and updating
* Building Linux devices and applications
* Low-level desktop technologies
* Networking
* System and service management
* Tracing and performance measuring
* IPC and RPC systems
* Security and Sandboxing

While our focus is definitely more on the user-space side of things, talks about kernel projects are welcome, as long as they have a clear and direct relevance for user-space.

## Pre- and post-conference community Hackfests

In addition to the conference presentations, we, the All Systems Go! organizing team, offer to assist projects in organizing project-specific hackfests in the days preceding and following the conference. If you would like to make use of this offer, [register your interest here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vTrcxhmdFoGaNTVvDMLyI0k-kvaTBsRs5w1WkQevsJ8/). We will attempt to match project requests with companies in Berlin that can offer space that fits your project’s needs.

## Thanks to our sponsors!
